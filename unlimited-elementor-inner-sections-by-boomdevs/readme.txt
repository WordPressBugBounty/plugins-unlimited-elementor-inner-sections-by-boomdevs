== Description ==

Prime Elementor Addons is a lightweight **Elementor addon plugin** for WordPress that gives you a focused set of **Elementor widgets** to build modern pages faster. Instead of installing many separate Elementor extensions, you can design key sections using one clean widget pack.

It includes the widgets most websites actually need - like **Advanced Accordion**, **Advanced Tabs**, **Advanced Heading**, **Call to Action**, **Pricing Table**, **Testimonial**, **Team Member**, **Countdown**, **Counter Number**, **Progressbar**, **Post Grid**, **Social Icons**, and more - so you can create complete landing pages and business pages with drag-and-drop.

Everything works inside the Elementor editor with simple controls. Add a widget, write your content, style it, and publish - no extra setup, no complicated steps, and no coding required.
